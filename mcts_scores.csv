Hi James,

Thanks for getting back to me!

Regarding your questions, my focus is on applying machine learning and AI to tackle intricate challenges. For example, I developed a trading bot using reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust trading strategies based on live market conditions. My technical skills include Python, C++, and TensorFlow.

While I'm deeply involved in AI/ML, I'm also keen to expand into backend development during an internship at Apple. I believe my AI/ML projects have honed my analytical and problem-solving skills, which I can readily apply to Apple's backend development, especially in optimizing cloud infrastructure.

Would you be available for a call next week to discuss how my skills can benefit Apple?
