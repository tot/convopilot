Hi James,

Thanks for getting back to me! I appreciate the opportunity to share more.

My background is heavily rooted in machine learning and AI, with projects like a machine learning-driven trading bot demonstrating [quantifiable result or specific achievement]. While I'm excited about the possibilities within AI/ML, I'm also keen to expand my skillset into backend development. I see an internship at Apple as the perfect chance to contribute to impactful projects while gaining valuable experience in this area.

Would you be open to a brief chat next week to discuss how my skills and aspirations could align with Apple's internship program?

Best,

Hi James,

Thank you for your prompt response!

In answer to your questions, my experience centers around machine learning and AI. For example, I developed an ML-based trading bot using Python with libraries like Pandas and NumPy. Beyond that, I'm proficient in C++ and have experience with AWS.

I'm particularly drawn to backend development for my internship, as I am seeking to broaden my skills in that area. I believe that the analytical rigor I developed in my AI projects would be directly transferable and beneficial in a backend role at Apple.

Would you be available for a brief call next week to discuss how my unique blend of AI experience and backend aspirations could align with Apple's internship program?

Best regards,
